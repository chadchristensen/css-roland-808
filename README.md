# HTML & CSS Roland 808 Drum Machine

This is a creative coding project to recreate the iconic Roland 808 drum machine released in 1980.  The sounds of this drum machine permeated multiple music genres including southern hip-hop and pop.  There is no mistaking the sound of that deep booming bass or the hard cracking snare ðŸ”Š.

The 808s are a bit too expensive to buy so I decided to create this digital one for all to enjoy.
